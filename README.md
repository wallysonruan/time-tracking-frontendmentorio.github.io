# Time Tracking â€“ A challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/time-tracking-dashboard-UIQ7167Jw)

*This project started on 01/08/2021.*

## Why this challenge?

I asked a friend to choose one of the Front End Challenges in the Junior level list, he chose this one. A few weeks later, after having studied a bit of object oriented programming in Javascript (OOPJS), I found this project quite a challenge, so this is no longer only a friend's choice, it's mine too.

## What do I expect to do in this project?

1. Learn MarkDown syntax, to avoid using HTML in the README.
2. Learn and practice how to access local external JSON files, consume them and, using OOPJS, show the data on the site.
3. Use JQUERY for the first time.

*This README will be updated whenever I feel the need to. Everytime I update it I'll be adding the date right before the updated part.*
