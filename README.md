# Time Tracking – A challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/time-tracking-dashboard-UIQ7167Jw)

*This project started on 01/08/2021.*

## Why this challenge?

I asked a friend to choose one of the Front End Challenges in the Junior level list, he chose this one. A few weeks later, after having studied a bit of object oriented programming in Javascript (OOPJS), I found this project quite a challenge, so this is no longer only a friend's choice, it's mine too.

## What do I expect to do in this project?

1. Learn MarkDown syntax, to avoid using HTML in the README.
2. Learn and practice how to access local external JSON files, consume them and, using OOPJS, show the data on the site.
3. Use JQUERY for the first time.

## What did I learn?

*01/08/2021:*
  1. The first attempt went wrong because I was losing myself in the "class soup", to solve that I abandoned that project, got the final design ([click here to see it](https://github.com/wallysonruan/time-tracking-frontendmentorio.github.io/blob/main/goal.png)) and used the PowerPoint to break it into boxes and, without a line of code, listed the classes names ([Click here to see it.](https://github.com/wallysonruan/time-tracking-frontendmentorio.github.io/blob/main/classes.png)). Even though the last project doesn't really use those classes names, that method surely helped me.
  2. As I'm not used to really use the versioning of GIHUB I created a new HTML file and named it "index-v2.hmtl", then I tried to access the final project throught GITHUB PAGES and the README file was displayed. After researching and trying somethings, I managed to solve the problem. GITHUB PAGES will priorize the index.html file, but if there's no such file it'll use the README file instead.
  3. I finished the mobile version on the second attempt, but when I tried to add the responsiveness to desktop devices using media queries I saw it was a bad code. I had coded all the layout and the it's elements using FLEXBOX and I was having troubles trying to adapt it to desktop devices, so I abbandoned that project. *01/09/2021:*(continuation) The new attempt was made using GRID for the bigger layout (the cards positions) and FLEXBOX for the elements and it's elements (the cards structure and it's children).

  1. The front-end of the mobile and desktop versions are ready, except for the hover state of the secondary cards of the statistics cards – I havent figured out which color I should use.
